## About Voice Unleashed 
Approximately 1% of the world's population stutters, which is approximately 80 million people. This is an application designed to help users, especially those who stutter, improve their communication skills 
and achieve long-term fluency. Thus, this application has the potential to become pretty influential for numerous users who stutter. However, this application can be used by anyone who wants to improve 
their communication skills and presence.
